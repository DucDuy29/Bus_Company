Tuấn Hiệp,"Zero Stars - Terrible Bus Experience This bus journey was an absolute nightmare, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. From start to finish, everything about this service was horrendous. First, the condition of the bus was appalling. The AC vents couldn’t be turned off, making the temperature unbearable, and the blankets provided were dirty. The entire bus felt rundown and in desperate need of maintenance. But the worst part was the staff and the endless delays. The bus did start on time, but then it stopped every 5-10 minutes, constantly picking up and dropping off boxes, packages, and goods. We couldn’t understand why we were stopping so frequently, and it was incredibly frustrating. On top of that, despite having dedicated pick-up points, the bus kept making unscheduled stops at every bus station along the route to pick up more passengers. All of this resulted in a massive delay of more than 3 hours on a journey that was supposed to take 6-7 hours. We ended up taking over 10 hours to get from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh City, a trip that was clearly misrepresented when we booked. The staff didn’t help at all—they ignored our questions and offered no assistance. When we asked about how much longer it would take, they simply didn’t answer. They also kept on taking longer routes to pick more passengers. At one point, they even misinformed us about the remaining distance, which led to us getting so frustrated that we had to get off the bus in the middle of the highway and take a Grab to Ho Chi Minh City. This not only wasted time but also cost us extra money. To top it all off, the bus itself was cramped and uncomfortable. It’s definitely not suitable for taller passengers. Please, do yourself a favor and avoid this bus service at all costs. It was a terrible experience from start to finish, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.",0.0004,0.9996

Tuấn Hiệp,"terrible company! I will never use their services again, although the price is inexpensive, but it’s not worth it, instead of two o’clock in the afternoon, we left at one in the afternoon, instead of arriving at 21.20 in the evening, we arrived at almost 12 at night, stops every 10 minutes and costs , disgusting trip. instead of the promised seven hours and twenty minutes on the road, the journey took more than eleven",0.0009,0.9991

Trí Nhân,"After all our bus trip was okay. We went to the bus stop at 9.30am (a bit earlier) like was said in the reservation. The bus came finally 10.45am. First bus was some kind of pick up-bus and collected people all around of the city. We didn't know about that system so we were quite confused, especially because the driver didn't speak english. When everyone was on, the bus took us to the final bus, which was fancy (beds in two floors, airconditioner, blankets etc). The bus was supposed to leave from Ho Chi Minh City at 11am but we left at 12 so we were an hour late. Staff was pretty nice but they didn't speak english at all, not even one word. After all we reached our destination, so that was good. And we had quite an adventure :D",0.9919,0.0081

Tân Niên,The location of departing was quite unclear. We were at the pick up location very early just to be sure we would make it. And then minutes before departing it was clear that it was not the pickup location... so we had to ran with all our baggage for a couple 100 meters. A bit intense...,0.0078,0.9922
Tân Niên,We booked the bus (without prepayment) with pick up at our hotel. The Pickup did not show up and we did not get to take the bus. We do not speak vietnamese but our reception from the hotel tried to contact the bus. They then told him that we should take a Taxi because they could not pick us up. When we were in the Taxi they told us the bus already left. Also the number that vexere provided as phone number from the driver did not exist.,0.0004,0.9996

Tân Niên,"The single beds are very comfortable for one person, but they are also sold as double beds. In my opinion, it is not comfortable at all for two people.

Dũng Lệ,"Horrible experience! Please avoid this company! Bad organization, late for pickup and extremely late for drop-off (the ride took 3 hours more than scheduled). The bus stopped multiple times to pick up cargo like eggs and big bags of stuff, which seemed unprofessional (probably the staff has ""small side business"".

Toàn Khải,"We booked for two VIP seats (300,000 each) as they are larger. When we got on the bus they had changed buses and moved our seats to the back which are the 250,000 seats. These are also much smaller and quite tight. I am pregnant which is why we wanted the bigger seats. Otherwise we would have booked a different time. After sending a complaint they moved me to the front vacant seat however that was only 1.5 hour into the trip. And my husband had to remain at the back. I have been trying to get a refund for the 100,000 as we didn't get the seats we paid for. However there has been no support or response. Finally, the trip was meant to be 4 hours total. It was 6 hours in the end. This was not because of traffic. The bus driver got lost and did different routes which even some of the Vietnamese staff started to ask him questions about what he was doing. He also wasn't very friendly when I tried to explain my situation at the beginning and didn't seem friendly when other members of the bus also were asking about the route.

So, with our pile of luggage for our 5 weeks of travel sitting on a sidewalk on a dark sidestreet, we had to order a GRAB Car to get to the bus station.

Duy Thảo (Kiên Giang),The driver claimed to arrive 20 minutes earlier which he announced by callig me 30 minutes in advance. On top of that not on the selected pickup station. Then we waited there for 40 minutes so that the bus came later than listed on the original ticket. When entering the bus our seats where occupied and on top of that one of the guy providing the service tried to sell us a transport/car to the drop-off point which we were supposed to be dropped-off anyway.

Shortly before reaching Can Tho, I, along with other passengers, was abruptly and loudly reprimanded in Vietnamese and subsequently forced to disembark from the bus after crossing a bridge. This unexpected and disconcerting situation caused inconvenience and confusion, as our taxi, which was already waiting at the Can Tho bus station, had to search for our whereabouts. I am deeply disappointed with the level of service provided by your company and will refrain from utilizing your services in the future. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Marco",0.0034,0.9966

There was only one toilet stop, so it was quite difficult to wait and the driver wasn't cooperative. We arrived to Nha Trang two hours earlier, which is a good thing, but the manager never warned us that it's our stop. So in general bus fulfilled all it's duties, but I really wish they could be more cooperative about toilet stops and more attentive about your destination stop if you arrive early.

Liên Hưng,"Crazy trip from center of Nha Trang to Da Nang. First, there was a minivan transfer from bus station to sleep bus and there is not enough seats for passengers, so I had to use plastic stool, which I’ve got after bad long conversation with service women. We with my wife bought a ticket next place to the driver and it was a HUGE mistake. The driver and his friend (colleague?) chatting loudly all the way. When they stop chatting - they start to beeping to others multiple times. My wife ask the driver to keep quit, but they only laughing and continue. I felt that I’m an astronaut, who train to take a mission, especially on the turns. They loaded cargo multiple times. It’s not a VIP Limousine Sleep Bus, it’s a Rollercoaster Terror I-Bet-You-Can’t-Sleep Bus. The bus was clean and seats (beds?) was a comfy, but u can’t sleep even.",0.0018,0.9982

He drove like crazy and honked the horn constantly. It was impossible to sleep, and we arrived an hour early - at 7:30 in the morning. Why? There were no sanitary stops at all, the toilet in the cabin was bad, and the shaking made it very difficult to use. Will not recommend no one. This is not VIP at all.",0.0007,0.9993

Quang Hạnh (NT),"They changed the time several times. We chose 1300, they changed to 9:30am and then last night changed again to 7:50am. They didn't also give the exact address of the pick up point. My sister messaged the contact which is indicated on their email and ticket and not responsive at all. So my sister went to a wrong address, they said it's not that office it's in a different one. My sister arrived there 7am and said that the trip is at 9am. The bus arrived at 9:30am The toilet inside the bus is out of service , sink was filthy. Thats one of the purpose why I booked that for my sister because of the toilet. Very disappointed!",0.0002,0.9998
Quang Hạnh (NT),"If you're a masochist, come here! This was our (and the girl's) first experience using sleeping buses. There was an option for 330000 VND and for 600000, we decided to try a more comfortable version of the bus. So, a little bit about the service: 1) Having come with a girl to the transport office in Nha Trang, 2 employees ignored us for several minutes, having no clients at the moment. Both of them were just carefully looking at the computer, not even looking in our direction and not asking to wait. 2) Due to the bus delay, the flight was postponed from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. (no problem), but this was not reported in the application (Vexere), by phone, SMS or email. Then we found out that you can track the bus in the app, which is very convenient. 3) Then the most interesting thing began: As soon as we boarded the bus, one of the staff (an elderly gray-haired man) began to scold us in a raised voice for going without taking off our shoes (no one warned us about this in advance). Next, to show the e-tickets, I gave him my phone, and when he looked, I reached out to give my phone back - he started literally yelling at me without giving the phone back. At the same time, he physically tried to push us to our seats. Seeing that I wasn't leaving without my phone, he handed it over and we went to our seats. At this point, we were ready to go outside, but he seemed to calm down and we were back in our seats. 4) Some time after departure, another young guy opened my curtain without warning to offer water. It's not pleasant. 5) I woke up to the fact that the same elderly gray-haired man was walking through the cabin and waking up passengers who were going to Da Nang, saying ""Hello, Danang"". Although it was 4 HOURS before arriving in the city. Not 15 minutes, not an hour, but FOUR! P.S. 1: I'm just adding that there is a toilet at the end of the cabin, which stinks and it's better to take tickets closer to the driver. P.S. 2: The rating is 2 stars instead of one only because of the comfortable driving and the condition of the buses.",0.0007,0.9993

I booked seat but when I got bus, it was occupied by other person. full of people on the bus already. Waited hot outside from bus terminal (not located as on their map) more than half an hour. Bus was supposed to be started Can tho bus terminal 14:40. Arrived Soc Trang 15:20. Bus actually arrived almost 15:30. Ran speedy to near Soc Trang then ask me to take taxi then drop me off was 16:22. There’s no way the bus can be on schedule from the beginning ! I Have to pay 110000vnd additionally for taxi.

Reclined, you won't really fit if you're taller than 1.75 m. The AC barely worked and even then only at the window seats. Let's just say it's a very authentic experience.

Kim Hoàng,"When we arrived at the departing bus station in Ho Chi Min we weren't told that we would be catching a mini bus to the other bus. We figured it out through google translate with someone there, but it would have been nice to have been told beforehand. The bus trip itself was fine, the sleeper bus was novel and figuring out the correct place to hop off was challenging. But overall good!",0.9993,0.0007
Kim Hoàng,"Left 45mins late. Was messed around by driver assistant going from one bus to another without checking ticket. Requested him x3 to assist with adjusting seat. Was ignored x3. Driver assisted me to adjust seat. 20mins or so later driver assistant tapped me on shoulder whilst I was on phone and stood there without speaking. Stood for a min or two then sat down again. A while later he came to collect tickets. Showed him my online one. No, he wanted paper one. Translated n told him to take a screenshot. Again, a few mins later, wanted to see ticket again. I found him to be rude and arrogant. I'm a female traveller and have not experienced anything like this on public transport. Will not use them again",0.0023,0.9977

Kim Hoàng,"I had reserved 2 places A7 and A8 which should have been, in my opinion, seating. We found ourselves in the back of the bus, lying on berths in height (my hands touched the ceiling) with the impossibility of straightening ourselves and putting the seat in a wheelchair. Fortunately we only had a 2 hour drive. What is the point of choosing our seats on the internet if we end up with a different bus and unsuitable seats?",0.0012,0.9988

Tân Thanh Thuỷ,"We booked the bus from airport Saigon to Ben Tre. The operator called us and said they don't want to pick us up from the airport because they did not want to pay the airport fee, although the airport was listed as official pick up point in the app. We instead had to take a taxi to their office and pay the 160k VND ourselves.
